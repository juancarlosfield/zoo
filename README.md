# zoo

Create a zoo repository on your computer that meets the following requirements:

It should contain Markdown files for at least three different types of animals, with the name of at least one animal in each file.
Each file should have a header displaying the animal type, and an unordered list of the individual animal's names. For example, you might have a penguins.md file with the names "Joe Bob," "Sprinkles," and "Tabytha" in it. (If you're not feeling creative, we recommend using a name generator, such as the Name Genie (Links to an external site.).)
Commit each file individually, and check the status of your repository frequently.

When you're finished, upload a screenshot or text file of your relevant Terminal history log (which you can access with the Terminal command history), along with a zipped copy of your repository. The polar bear thanks you.

Headers
Use one or more # symbols to create a header. A # Header is larger than a ## Header
Lists
Use a * to create an unordered list element.
Use a number followed by a period 1. to create an ordered list.
Bold
Use *Bold Text* to create emphasis.
Code
Use 4 spaces indent or surround with single or triple ` (backticks) to create a code block. In GitHub you can add the code type as well.
Links
Use [Link Text](link url) format to create links.
